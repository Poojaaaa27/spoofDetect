# üß† Silent Face Anti-Spoofing Using MiniFASNet with Fourier Supervision

## üìå Overview
This project presents an enhanced implementation of a **Silent Face Anti-Spoofing system** inspired by the work of **MiniVision AI** ([MiniVision Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing](https://github.com/minivision-ai/Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing)). We build upon their approach with a focus on academic research, presenting a refined training methodology, Fourier-based supervision, and visualization tools to analyze performance. This repository is created as part of a research paper submission for an IEEE conference.

The system distinguishes between real and spoofed faces (e.g., photo, video, mask) using only RGB input without requiring user interaction.
